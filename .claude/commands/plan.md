Use the architect agent to plan the implementation of a new feature.

Process:
1. Understand the requirements from user input
2. Explore existing code patterns
3. Design component architecture
4. Plan implementation order
5. Identify edge cases and risks

Output a detailed implementation plan including:
- Component hierarchy
- File structure
- Types/interfaces
- Data flow
- Step-by-step implementation order
- Testing strategy
